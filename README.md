# Overview

This is a simple weather app that finds the weather for a certain location (in our case its Phoenix). This app tells the weather, humidity, windspeed, and current weather condition. This program uses the dart programming language and the flutter development enviornment. I wanted to create this app so I can create a mobile app using just one enviornment but be able to create an app for iOS and Android.

Below is the video of the working program.

# Development Environment

The enviornment that I used for this project is Flutter. Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. It uses Dart programming language and can be run natively on iOS(If you have a mac) and Android. I also imported things like "font_awesome_flutter" which has icons that we can use for the project to make it look a bit better.

# Future Work

* I would like to add more support to the application with scrollable pages.
* Make it look a lot cleaner and professional.
* Get it to run on Android with no issues.
